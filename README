== Why Trombi ?
Trombi is the beginning for the French word 'trombinoscope'. In French, a 'trombinoscope' is a document with a list of people (e.g. pupils) with their photographic portrait. A 'trombinoscope' is very useful to link a name with a face - especially in associations, classrooms when you meet many people...
